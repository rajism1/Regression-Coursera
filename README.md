##Overview
This analyzes the impact of Transmission on MPG of cars.  
for the analysis mtcars dataset has been used.

##Dataset
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).  

A data frame with 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables.

[, 1]	mpg	Miles/(US) gallon   
[, 2]	cyl	Number of cylinders   
[, 3]	disp	Displacement (cu.in.)   
[, 4]	hp	Gross horsepower   
[, 5]	drat	Rear axle ratio   
[, 6]	wt	Weight (1000 lbs)  
[, 7]	qsec	1/4 mile time   
[, 8]	vs	Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)   
[, 9]	am	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)   
[,10]	gear	Number of forward gears   
[,11]	carb	Number of carburetors   


##Analysis

*Linear regression on mpg and transmission    
*Multi variable regression to incorporate other variable in the analysis  
*Residual Diagnosis
